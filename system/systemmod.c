 * @brief The OpenPilot Modules do the majority of the control in OpenPilot.  The
 * @ref SystemModule "System Module" starts all the other modules that then take care
 * of all the telemetry and control algorithms and such.  This is done through the @ref PIOS
 * "PIOS Hardware abstraction layer" which then contains hardware specific implementations
 * (currently only STM32 supported)
 *
 * @{
 * @addtogroup SystemModule System Module
 * @brief Initializes PIOS and other modules runs monitoring
 * After initializing all the modules (currently selected by Makefile but in
 * future controlled by configuration on SD card) runs basic monitoring and
 * alarms.
